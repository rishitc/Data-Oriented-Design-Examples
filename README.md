# Data Oriented Design Guidelines
This repository contains the illustrated exaples for a set of actionable rules that are meant to be employed in order to enhance the code's cache friendliness, by reducing the number of L1/L2 cache misses, improving  the CPU utilization and reducing the overall runtime for a program.

# How to run the Each of the Project Folders:  
1. Vector Vs List
    - Go to the folder `vector_vs_list`
    - Enable the section of code to run in the file `p1.cpp`, i.e. either vector or list code
    - Run `make`
    - Run `./a.out <size_of_container>`
2. Collection for States
    - Go to the folder `Collection for States`
    - Run `make`
    - Run `./p1.out <number_of_agents>`
    - Run `./p2.out <number_of_agents>`
3. Image Manipulation
    - Go to the folder `image_manip`

4. Structure of Arrays Vs Array of Structures
    - Go to the folder `SoA_vs_AoS`
    - Enable the section of code to run in the file `p1.cpp`, i.e. either the Structure of Arrays or Array of Structures
    - Run `make`
    - Run `./a.out <number_of_object> <number_of_iterations_over_container>`
